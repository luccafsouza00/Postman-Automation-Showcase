# Postman-Automation-Showcase

This repository contains Postman collections I created to demonstrate my API testing and automation skills. These collections were developed as part of my learning journey through the **"Postman: The Complete Guide"** course by Valentin Despa on Udemy. Each collection focuses on how to work with APIs, write tests, and automate workflows.
